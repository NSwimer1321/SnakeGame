# SnakeGame
This game is a recreation of the Snake Game. The player plays as a chain of white circles, the snake, and moves around the board trying to
eat the blue and red circles, food, that appear on the board. Eating the food will allow the snake to grow. If the snake head hits the borders
of the map or the tail of the snake, then the game is lost. If the snake grows so large that the snake takes up 75% of the board, then the
game is won.
In order to easily play this game, go to the SnakeGameBuild folder and traverse to the build folder. The Main.exe file should run the game.
If you have any trouble, there should be another README inside the SnakeGameBuild folder that will have more detailed traversal 
instructions.
